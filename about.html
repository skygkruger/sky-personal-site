          My name is Skyler (“Sky”), a direct support professional in Bend, OR. 
          I work with individualswith intellectual and developmental disabilities. 
          My experience and deep love for the IDD community as well as my lifelong passion for technology
          have coalesced into a unique approach to cloud design and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          SkyCloud Solutions is my path into cloud engineering. I’m currently preparing for the AWS
          Cloud Practitioner exam while building AWS-backed tools and infrastructure for small teams,
          caregivers, and solo founders.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus is on:
          
        </p>
        <ul class="focus-list">
          <li>📦 Small, focused utilities not giant, exclusive dashboards</li>
          <li>🌐 Static, serverless architectures on AWS engineered with professional dynamism.</li>
          <li>🧠 Accessibility and calm UX for real-world users</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          Long-term, I aim for cloud platform roles of all types where I can enjoy boundless learning, help teams ship quiet,
          reliable systems — and keep building tools that continuously ease the lives of their users.
