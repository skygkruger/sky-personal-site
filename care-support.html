        <h2>Care Support Platform</h2>
        
        <p>
          A calm, focused space for caregivers, families, and individuals with intellectual and
          developmental disabilities.

        <p>
          I have worked as a direct support professional (DSP) for several years and my life has been forever enriched because of it. 
          When I finally began pursing an education in cloud technologies, my immediate goal became to explore the fusion of these experiences, not isolate them from eachother. 
          The mission of this project is to create a central, accessible hub where caregivers and
          families alike can discover tools, resources, and support without wading through the noisy, ad-filled
          sites and often hostile internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the platform evolves, it will host micro-tools, resource libraries, and guided workflows
          designed specifically for support professionals, supported individuals, and their families.
